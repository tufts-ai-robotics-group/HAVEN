# HRI-based Augmentation  in  a  Virtual  robot  Environment  using  uNity (HAVEN)
## A modular robotics environment built in Unity Version 2018.4.23f1

The goal of this project is to provide a modular robotics environment that will allow researchers and developers to build upon and create new modules to 
fit their specific goals and needs.

## Current Modules:
### Robots:
* TurtleBot2 
	* Realistic Movement
	* Battery Level

### Visualizations:
* Path Projection (TurtleBot2)
	* How far to project is adjustable (TurtleBot2)
* Turn Signals (TurtleBot2)
* Thought Bubble (TurtleBot2)
* Battery Level (TurtleBot2)

### Scenarios:
* Hallway Passing (TurtleBot2)

* Object Retrieval (TurtleBot2)
	* Current Progress: Turtlebot2 navigates to and collects all gems in random order
	* WIP: Getting the Turtlebot2 to navigate around the human if the human obstructs its path
